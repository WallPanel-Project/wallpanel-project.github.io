# Welcome to WallPanel!
You have successfully installed a WallPanel app on your Android device!

At this time you will want to configure your app to have a different "Launch URL". The app will start that URL when starting fresh, so it should be the URL of your target dashboard. This can be any web page your device can reach that you wish to display on your wall. Tap the "Back" button in your app to go to the configuration screen.

Have fun!
